## There is an online education platform from which the following data are uploaded:

- information about grades in subject tests
- list of courses by semesters
- student test scores
- information on the time the student registered for the course


## It is necessary to analyze the data and answer the following questions:

1. How many students have passed only one course successfully? (A successful pass is a course credit on an exam)?
2. Identify the hardest and easiest exams: Find the courses and exams in the course that have the lowest and highest completion rates (*completion rate = number of successful exams / number of all attempts to take the exam)
3. For each course, determine the average time for passing the exams (by passing we mean the last successful completion of the exam by the student)
4. Identify the most popular courses (Top 3) by the number of registrations for them. As well as courses with the biggest churn (Top 3)
5. Write a function that allows you to build a cohort (semester) analysis. From the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014, identify the semester with the lowest course completion rate and the longest average course turnaround time
6. Build adapted student RFM clusters, for qualitative audience assessment.

## The analysis was done in Python, the conclusions are in the file E-learning.ipynb.
